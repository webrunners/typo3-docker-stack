# Contribute to TYPO3 CMS on docker example

Want to hack on the TYPO3 CMS on docker example? Awesome! 

## Pull requests are always welcome

Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Found a bug and know how to fix
it? Do it! We will appreciate it.

### Conventions

Fork the repository and make changes on your fork in a feature branch:

- If it's a bug fix branch, name it FIX-XXXX-something where XXXX is the number of
	the issue. 
- If it's a feature branch, create an enhancement issue to announce
	your intentions, and name it TASK-XXXX-something where XXXX is the number of the
	issue.

Update the documentation when creating or modifying features. Test your
documentation changes for clarity, concision, and correctness, as well as a
clean documentation build.

Write clean code. Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading,
and maintenance.

Pull request descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a reference
to all the issues that they address.

### Commit Messages

Commit messages must start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50 chars)
written in the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory
text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Commit messages should follow best practices, including explaining the context
of the problem and how it was solved, including in caveats or follow up changes
required. They should tell the story of the change and provide readers
understanding of what led to it.

If you're lost about what this even means, please see [How to Write a Git
Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for a start.
